In the Castilian Cortes of Valladolid in 1506 and of Madrid in 1510 Charles was sworn as the Prince of Asturias heir-apparent to his mother the Queen Joanna
On the other hand in 1502 the Aragonese Corts gathered in Saragossa and pledged an oath to Joanna as heiress-presumptive but the Archbishop of Saragossa expressed firmly that this oath could not establish jurisprudence that is to say modify the right of the succession except by virtue of a formal agreement between the Cortes and the King
So upon the death of King Ferdinand II of Aragon on 23 January 1516 Joanna inherited the Crown of Aragon which consisted of Catalonia Valencia Naples Sicily and Sardinia while Charles became Governor General
Nevertheless the Flemings wished Charles to assume the royal title and this was supported by his grandfather the emperor Maximilian I and Pope Leo X


Thus after the celebration of Ferdinand II's obsequies on 14 March 1516 Charles was proclaimed king of the crowns of Castile and Aragon jointly with his mother
Finally when the Castilian regent Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros accepted the fait accompli he acceded to Charles's desire to be proclaimed king and imposed his enstatement throughout the kingdom
Charles arrived in his new kingdoms in autumn of 1517
Jiménez de Cisneros came to meet him but fell ill along the way not without a suspicion of poison and he died before meeting the King

Due to the irregularity of Charles assuming the royal title while his mother the legitimate queen was alive the negotiations with the Castilian Cortes in Valladolid proved difficult
In the end Charles was accepted under the following conditions: he would learn to speak Castilian; he would not appoint foreigners; he was prohibited from taking precious metals from Castile; and he would respect the rights of his mother Queen Joanna
The Cortes paid homage to him in Valladolid in February 1518
After this Charles departed to the crown of Aragon
He managed to overcome the resistance of the Aragonese Cortes and Catalan Corts and he was finally recognized as king of Aragon and count of Barcelona jointly with his mother
 The Kingdom of Navarre had been invaded by Ferdinand of Aragon jointly with Castile in 1512 but he pledged a formal oath to respect the kingdom
On Charles's accession to the Spanish throne the Parliament of Navarre required him to attend the coronation ceremony but this demand fell on deaf ears and the Parliament kept piling up grievances
